    OPT   This kernel grid is too small to fill the available resources on this device, resulting in only 0.0 full      
          waves across all SMs. Look at Launch Statistics for more details.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 1      
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to     
          kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model

          The grid for this launch is configured to execute only 1 blocks, which is less than the GPU's 82              
          multiprocessors. This can underutilize some multiprocessors. If you do not intend to execute this kernel      
          concurrently with other workloads, consider reducing the block size to have at least one block per            
          multiprocessor or increase the size of the grid to fully utilize the available hardware resources. See the

          This kernel's theoretical occupancy (33.3%) is limited by the number of blocks that can fit on the SM. This   
          kernel's theoretical occupancy (33.3%) is limited by the required amount of shared memory. The difference     
          between calculated theoretical (33.3%) and measured achieved occupancy (2.1%) can be the result of warp       
          scheduling overheads or workload imbalances during the kernel execution. Load imbalances can occur between    
          warps within a block as well as across blocks of the same kernel. See the CUDA Best Practices Guide           
          (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-best-practices-guide/index.html#occupancy) for more details on           
          optimizing occupancy.
